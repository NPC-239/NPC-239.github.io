    <h3>Einstein's Relativity</h3>
    <p>For Einstein's Relativity formula you have to use the superscript (&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;) and italic (&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;) tags. It is wrapped in heading 2 (&lt;h2&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;) tags to make it larger and bolder. <b>NOTE: be careful with proper nesting to ensure the page passes the XHTML validator. This line is bolded using the bold (&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;) tags.</b></p>
    <h2><i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i></h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Currency Conversion (use of special characters)</h3>
    <p>Hey, that's pretty cool. I wonder if this standard still holds up today or if this is an old example. But I'm sick, I travel in crutches, and I'm highkey bitter of that fact so this is as much modification as I'm doing.</p>
    <h2>$1.00CDN = $0.703USD = &pound;0.487 = &euro;0.651 = &yen;82.77</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Code Snippet</h3>
    <p>I remember doing Java for OOP1. I was constantly copy and pasting these specific constants, mainly SET_TITLE and BANNER due to the formatting being essential when launching the code. It would replace the label of the title to something more coherent and also display the name of the banner in the code itself. I would then change the name of the banner to whatever code we were working on, in this case, it was learning about colors.</p>
    <code>    // Constants<br/>
        static final String SET_TITLE = "\033]0;%s\007";<br/>
        static final String SET_COLOR = "\033[%sm";<br/>
        static final String BANNER = """<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;==================<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;= COLOR OVERLOAD =<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;==================<br/>
                """;</code>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Chemistry Equation</h3>
    <p>I actually never took chemistry, so I have no idea what this means. Where does that second O particle go after it's with heat? Is it equivalent to it? What? What does this even mean. Seriously.</p>
    <h2>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> =&gt; 2H<sub>2</sub>O + heat</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>List Example (order important)</h3>
    <h2>How to conceal a fart</h2>
    <p>We've all been there. You're having a good time with your friends, when suddenly you need to pass gas. You shouldn't feel ashamed of such a normal act, but alas, it still is disgusting. Want to do it without admitting you're the one who dealt it? Then follow these simple steps.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to evacuate or excuse yourself to a secluded area. After all, if no one's around, who cares about the surround sound?</li>
        <li>If you need this step, you couldn't get away. Make sure you're sitting down, and relax the cheeks.</li>
        <li>Bring some oxygen in your system. Take a deep breath, and exhale. This allows your cheeks to pass gas without a sound.</li>
        <li>LAST RESORT: Drop something loud, or cough if you know this one is a banger. If the room is loud anyways, pass it as loud as you'd like. Masking through ambience is your friend.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr/>
    <h3>List Example (order unimportant)</h3>
    <h2>My current to-do list</h2>
    <p>It's quite amazing that I got sick like this. I woke up today, tired out of my mind, not wanting to do anything because I was busy curling my cold body into that of a shrimp platter. DAMN! So here's what I got to do without any specific order.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>See the doctor.</li>
        <li>Renew my health card.</li>
        <li>Figure out what the problem Github has with me uploading to the darn thing.</li>
        <li>Play Baldur's Gate for closure. (after hw)</li>
    </ul>
